This folder is for my Summer 2018 project at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Computational and Systems Biology.
This is an attempt at creating a nerual network model using the framework Caffe that can take data representing protein ligand interactions with randomly translated and rotated ligands and output a transformation back to the initial pose. 

-- Download Caffe from the gnina source and figure out how to build it
-- Design the first architechture that I will be attempting to train
-- Look into how to make the trigonometric function layer in caffe that dkoes mentioned
-- Make scripts that make training on different variations of the models simple
-- Make scripts that automatically generate visualizations
-- Look into using the pycaffe library because it will be useful when making scripts 
-- Look into using pymol or another molecular visualizations platform to visualize the results
